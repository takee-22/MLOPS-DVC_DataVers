1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
